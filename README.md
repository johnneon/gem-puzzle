The game is a set of identical square dice with applied numbers, enclosed in a square box. The length of the side of the box is four times the length of the side of the knuckles for a set of 15 elements, respectively, one square field remains empty in the box. The goal of the game is to move the knuckles around the box, to achieve ordering them by numbers, preferably by making as few movements as possible

 - Used eslint (eslint-config-airbnb-base), webpack
 - Implemented the ability to save the game (for example, using localStorage), when you reload the page, you can continue from the same place where you left off
 - Implemented the ability to select the size of the field: from 3x3 to 8x8
 - Implemented animation of moving tags on the field
 - The top 10 results are saved to the high score table and can be viewed in any way (for example, by pressing a button)
